# 3gpp-release-fetcher
Fetches and converts 3GPP 5G specifications to PDF.

## Description
The latest 3GPP specification releases are [publicly available](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/latest/) via FTP. As the files are zipped and of .doc format they are cumbersome to open and read. This repository fetches, unzips and uses a hosted [Gotenberg](https://gotenberg.dev/) instance to convert all specifications of a certain release to PDFs.
